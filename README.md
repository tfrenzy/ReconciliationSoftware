# ReconciliationSoftware
This project was a demo of a reconciliation software for the bursary unit of the University of Port Harcourt. The software was developed to reconcile differences between their cashbook and bank records in an effort to weed out errors and find discrepancies in bank and cashbook statements. The project was implemented in java.
